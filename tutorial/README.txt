This directory contains the Gmsh tutorial. The tutorial files introduce new
features gradually, starting with the first tutorial, `t1.geo'.

The `.geo' files are written in Gmsh's built-in scripting language. You can open
them directly with the Gmsh app: in the graphical user interface (GUI), just go
to `File->Open', select the file and choose "Open"; on the command line, run
"gmsh t1.geo" (which will launch the GUI) or "gmsh t1.geo -2" (to mesh in batch
mode).

Binary versions of the Gmsh app for Windows, Linux and macOS can be downloaded
from http://gmsh.info. Several Linux distributions also ship the Gmsh app. See
the top-level `README.txt' file in the Gmsh source code for instructions on how
compile the app from source.

The `c++', `c', `python' and `julia' subdirectories contain C++, C, Python and
Julia versions of (some of these) tutorials, written using the Gmsh Application
Programming Interface (API): you will need the Gmsh dynamic library and the
associated header files (for C++ and C) or modules (for Python and Julia) to run
them.

A binary Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows, Linux and macOS, that
contains the dynamic Gmsh library and the associated header and module files,
can be downloaded from http://gmsh.info. Several Linux distributions also ship
the Gmsh SDK. See the top-level `README.txt' in the Gmsh source code for
instructions on how to compile the dynamic Gmsh library from source.

Each subdirectory contains additional information on how to run the examples for
each API language.
